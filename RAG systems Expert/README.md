Modeling and Simulation RAG System
Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide information about modeling and simulation using a combination of a local vector store and a Large Language Model (LLM). It leverages LangChain, FAISS, and Groq’s API to retrieve relevant document chunks from a user-provided document set and generate accurate, context-aware responses to queries about modeling and simulation (e.g., "What is simulation?").
Key Features

Document Ingestion: Processes text files in the docs/ directory to create a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Combines document retrieval with Groq’s LLM (e.g., llama3-8b-8192) to answer queries.
Fallback Mechanism: Returns raw retrieved documents if the LLM API is unreachable due to network issues.
Interactive CLI: Allows users to ask questions and receive answers based on the document set.

Quick Start Guide
Setting Up the Environment
To use this RAG system, you must configure your Groq API key in a .env file. This key enables the system to connect to Groq’s Large Language Model (LLM) for generating answers about modeling and simulation.

Obtain a Groq API Key:

Sign up or log in at console.groq.com to get your API key.
Copy the key (e.g., gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx).


Create the .env File:

In the project root directory (/home/tszj/Agents/RAG systems Expert/), create a file named .env:touch .env


Open the file in a text editor (e.g., nano .env) and add:GROQ_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

Replace your-api-key-here with your actual Groq API key. Example:GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


Save and close the file. Ensure .env is not committed to version control (it’s typically included in .gitignore).



Preparing Documents
The system retrieves information from text files in the docs/ directory to answer questions about modeling and simulation. Ensure this directory contains relevant .txt files.

Example Documents:
Create docs/simulation.txt with content like:Simulation is the imitation of a real-world process or system over time, often used in AI to model behaviors and predict outcomes.


Create docs/modeling.txt with:Modeling involves creating representations of systems to study their behavior, such as mathematical models or simulations in AI.




Place these files in /home/tszj/Agents/RAG systems Expert/docs/. The system will use these to answer queries like “What is simulation?” or “What is the role of modeling in AI?”.

Installation Guide

Clone the Repository:git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>


Create a Virtual Environment:python3 -m venv .ragenv
source .ragenv/bin/activate


Install Dependencies:pip install --upgrade langchain langchain-huggingface langchain-groq langchain-community faiss-cpu sentence-transformers pypdf python-dotenv

Alternatively, if you have a requirements.txt:pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

Generate the Vector Store:

Run the ingestion script to process documents into a FAISS vector store:python3 generate_vector_embeddings.py


This creates the faiss_index/ directory, which stores document embeddings for retrieval.


Query the System:

Start the interactive CLI to ask questions about modeling and simulation:python3 language_model.py


Enter questions (e.g., “What is simulation?”) and receive answers based on the documents in docs/.
If the Groq API is unavailable (e.g., due to network issues), the system will display raw document chunks as a fallback.
Type exit to quit.


Expected Output:

When you ask a question like “What is simulation?”, the system retrieves relevant document chunks and generates a response using Groq’s LLM. Example:Ask a question (or 'exit' to quit): What is simulation?
Answer: Simulation is the imitation of a real-world process or system over time, often used in AI to model behaviors and predict outcomes.
